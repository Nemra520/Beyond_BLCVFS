### Key Components

#### 1. **BLC Types & Parser** ([types.rs](src/VFS/BLC/types.rs), [parser.rs](src/VFS/BLC/parser.rs))
- `BlcMainInfo`: Main information block structure
- `ChunkInfo`: Chunk metadata
- `FileInfo`: Individual file information
- `UInt128`: 128-bit MD5 hash representation

#### 2. **Cryptographic Module** ([crypto.rs](src/VFS/BLC/crypto.rs))
- ChaCha20 stream cipher implementation
- Automatic BLC file decryption
- Per-file decryption support

#### 3. **Virtual File System** ([VFS/mod.rs](src/VFS/mod.rs))
- BLC file mounting and management
- CHK file mapping for integrity verification
- Unified file reading interface
- Transparent decryption layer

#### 4. **Error Handling** ([error.rs](src/VFS/BLC/error.rs))
- Comprehensive error type definitions
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
  - Minimum Rust Edition: 2021
  - Recommended: Latest stable release

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd blc-vfs

# Build release version
cargo build --release
```

The build process will produce two binaries:
- `blc-vfs-cli.exe` - Command-line interface
- `blc-vfs-gui.exe` - Graphical user interface

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Start interactive CLI
./target/release/blc-vfs-cli.exe

# Available commands:
mount <blc_file> [chk_folder]    # Mount a BLC file (optionally specify CHK folder)
list                               # List all mounted files
extract <file_path>                # Extract a single file
extract-all [output_dir]           # Extract all files to directory
info                               # Display VFS information
help                               # Show available commands
quit / exit                        # Exit the program
```

### GUI Usage

```bash
# Launch graphical interface
./target/release/blc-vfs-gui.exe
```

The GUI provides:
- 📁 Package browser with drag-and-drop support
- 🔍 Real-time file search functionality
- 📊 Progress tracking during extraction
- 🎨 Modern, responsive interface


## ✅ Verified Capabilities

- ✅ Successfully mount BLC files
- ✅ Parse complete file listings
- ✅ Extract individual and batch files
- ✅ Automatic decryption of encrypted content
- ✅ Support for multiple platforms (Windows, Android bundles)
- ✅ Memory-efficient large file handling

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Memory Mapping (mmap)**: Zero-copy reads for large files using `memmap2`
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded extraction via `rayon`
3. **Efficient Cryptography**: Stream cipher operations minimize memory overhead
4. **Type Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without garbage collection

### Comparison with Python Implementation

| Feature | Python Version | This Implementation |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Performance | Slower | ~10-50x faster |
| Memory Usage | Higher | Significantly lower |
| Type Safety | Dynamic typing | Static typing |
| Error Handling | Exceptions | Result<T, E> pattern |
| Concurrency | GIL limited | Native multi-threading |
| Binary Size | Requires interpreter | Single executable |
